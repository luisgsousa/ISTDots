# ISTDots
 It is a Candy Crush type game, but very simplified

 To run the game just open the terminal in the folder and run the comand "./ISTDots". It will then ask you for your username, table size preference, number of colours in the game, objectives for each colour and maximum moves allowed. Connect the dots of the same colour according to the objectives above and to the maximum moves. If you form a square, every dot inside it will also disappear.
